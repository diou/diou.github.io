I am happy to announce that the paper "MAVias: Mitigate any Visual Bias" of PhD candidate Ioannis Sarridis, in collaboration with Christos Koutlis and Symeon Papadopoulos  of CERTH/ITI has been accepted for publication in [ICCV 2025](https://iccv.thecvf.com/)!

The article proposes a method for bias mitigation in visual data, a challenging problem, given that in many cases the visual attributes that lead to false associations are unknown, making models susceptible to generalization errors. The paper proposes a method that takes advantage of foundation models to identify and represent features that lead to bias, as well as a novel method for bias mitigation during training. This leads to results that exceed the state of the art in the CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars & ImageNet9 datasets.
