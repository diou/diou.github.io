This semester I will be teaching a 6-week synchronous joint module with [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), along with my colleague, [Matthew Matsagkanis](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/matsaganis-matthew)! I am grateful to our students for their participation and for supporting this activity.
