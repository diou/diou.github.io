Today I was invited to give a talk on "AI in Eating and Physical Activity Interventions: Opportunities and Limitations" at [Institut Lyfe](https://en.institutlyfe.com/), at Lyon, France. I was really impressed by the facilities, dedication to deep research and the engagement of the research team at Lyfe!
