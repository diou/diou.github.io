Vasileios Gkolemis presented our papers ["Regionally Additive Models: Explainable-by-design models minimizing feature interactions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12215) at the "Uncertainty Meets Explainability in Machine Learning" workshop at ECML-PKDD, and  [RHALE: Robust and Heterogeneity-aware Accumulated Local Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11193) at ECAI 2023.
