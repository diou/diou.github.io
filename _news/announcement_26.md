Today I was very happy to be invited to give a keynote speech on [regional effect plots](https://vldb.org/workshops/2024/proceedings/TaDA/TaDA.5.pdf) and the [Effector](https://xai-effector.github.io/) package at the International Astronomer's Union [Symposium](https://universai2025.hua.gr/) on exploring the Universe with Artificial Intelligence.
