TITLE = {Ultra-Processed Food vs. Fruit and Vegetable Consumption before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Greek and Swedish Students},
JOURNAL = {Nutrients},
VOLUME = 15,
YEAR = {2023},
NUMBER = 10,

%ABSTRACT = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted children&rsquo;s lifestyles, including dietary behaviors. Of particular concern among these behaviors is the heightened prevalence of ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption, which has been linked to the development of obesity and related non-communicable diseases. The present study examines the changes in (1) UPF and (2) vegetable and/or fruit consumption among school-aged children in Greece and Sweden before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The analyzed dataset consisted of main meal pictures (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) captured by 226 Greek students (94 before the pandemic and 132 during the pandemic) and 421 Swedish students (293 before and 128 during the pandemic), aged 9&ndash;18, who voluntarily reported their meals using a mobile application. The meal pictures were collected over four-month periods over two consecutive years; namely, between the 20th of August and the 20th of December in 2019 (before the COVID-19 outbreak) and the same period in 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak). The collected pictures were annotated manually by a trained nutritionist. A chi-square test was performed to evaluate the differences in proportions before versus during the pandemic. Results: In total, 10,770 pictures were collected, including 6474 pictures from before the pandemic and 4296 pictures collected during the pandemic. Out of those, 86 pictures were excluded due to poor image quality, and 10,684 pictures were included in the final analyses (4267 pictures from Greece and 6417 pictures from Sweden). The proportion of UPF significantly decreased during vs. before the pandemic in both populations (50% vs. 46%, p = 0.010 in Greece, and 71% vs. 66%, p &lt; 0.001 in Sweden), while the proportion of vegetables and/or fruits significantly increased in both cases (28% vs. 35%, p &lt; 0.001 in Greece, and 38% vs. 42%, p = 0.019 in Sweden). There was a proportional increase in meal pictures containing UPF among boys in both countries. In Greece, both genders showed an increase in vegetables and/or fruits, whereas, in Sweden, the increase in fruit and/or vegetable consumption was solely observed among boys. Conclusions: The proportion of UPF in the Greek and Swedish students&rsquo; main meals decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic vs. before the pandemic, while the proportion of main meals with vegetables and/or fruits increased.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in addressing real-world tasks by harnessing data-driven insights to optimize and enhance decision-making processes. Their application in robotics usually relies on simulations as an essential testing ground, allowing us to refine solutions, minimize risks, and fine-tune algorithms before deploying them in practical, physical environments. In this work, we evaluate the performance of two popular reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q Network (DQN): i) on an obstacle detection and avoidance task, and ii) on a navigation task. For this purpose, we rely on the FOSSBot open-source educational robot, which contains ultrasonic sensors, infrared obstacle sensors, an Inertial Measurement Unit, and odometers. More specifically, we work on a simulation of FOSSBot in the CoppeliaSim environment. The evaluation results on the grid environment are very promising for our algorithms since the success rates (i.e. reaching the destination without collision) for both algorithms is above 93\%. As for the simulated environment, the results show the superiority of PPO over DQN, with PPO scoring a success rate of 74\%, making it a promising navigation algorithm candidate for the real-world FOSSBot.},
