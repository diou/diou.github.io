The collection of big data has begun to allow the exploration of causal associations between behavior, built environment, and obesity-relevant health outcomes. Here, we compare traditional epidemiologic vs. emerging big data approaches used in obesity research, describing the research questions, needs, and outcomes of three broad research domains: eating behavior, social food environments, and the built environment. Taking tangible steps at the intersection of these domains, the recent European Union project “BigO: Big data against childhood obesity” used a mobile health tool to link objective measurements of health, physical activity, and the built environment. BigO provided learnings on the limitations of big data, such as privacy concerns, study sampling, and the balancing of epidemiologic domain expertise with the required technical expertise. Adopting big data approaches will facilitate the exploitation of data concerning obesity-relevant behaviors of a greater variety, which are also processed at speed, facilitated by mobile-based data collection and monitoring systems, citizen science, and artificial intelligence. These approaches will allow the field to expand from causal inference to more complex, systems-level predictive models, stimulating ambitious and effective policy interventions.}",

These allow the study of eating behavior outside the laboratory in free-living conditions, without the need for video recordings and laborious manual annotations. In this paper, we present a high-level overview of our recent work on intake monitoring using a smartwatch, as well as methods using an in-ear microphone. We also present evaluation results of these methods in challenging, real-world datasets. Furthermore, we discuss use-cases of such intake monitoring tools for advancing research in eating behavior, for improving dietary monitoring, as well as for developing evidence-based health policies. Our goal is to inform researchers and users of intake monitoring methods regarding (i) the development of new methods based on commercially available devices, (ii) what to expect in terms of effectiveness, and (iii) how these methods can be used in research as well as in practical applications.}

%abstract="Background: Obesity is a major public health problem globally and in Europe. The prevalence of childhood obesity is also soaring. Several parameters of the living environment are contributing to this increase, such as the density of fast food retailers, and thus, preventive health policies against childhood obesity must focus on the environment to which children are exposed. Currently, there are no systems in place to objectively measure the effect of living environment parameters on obesogenic behaviors and obesity. The H2020 project ``BigO: Big Data Against Childhood Obesity'' aims to tackle childhood obesity by creating new sources of evidence based on big data. Objective: This paper introduces the Obesity Prevention dashboard (OPdashboard), implemented in the context of BigO, which offers an interactive data platform for the exploration of objective obesity-related behaviors and local environments based on the data recorded using the BigO mHealth (mobile health) app. Methods: The OPdashboard, which can be accessed on the web, allows for (1) the real-time monitoring of children's obesogenic behaviors in a city area, (2) the extraction of associations between these behaviors and the local environment, and (3) the evaluation of interventions over time. More than 3700 children from 33 schools and 2 clinics in 5 European cities have been monitored using a custom-made mobile app created to extract behavioral patterns by capturing accelerometer and geolocation data. Online databases were assessed in order to obtain a description of the environment. The dashboard's functionality was evaluated during a focus group discussion with public health experts. Results: The preliminary association outcomes in 2 European cities, namely Thessaloniki, Greece, and Stockholm, Sweden, indicated a correlation between children's eating and physical activity behaviors and the availability of food-related places or sports facilities close to schools. In addition, the OPdashboard was used to assess changes to children's physical activity levels as a result of the health policies implemented to decelerate the COVID-19 outbreak. The preliminary outcomes of the analysis revealed that in urban areas the decrease in physical activity was statistically significant, while a slight increase was observed in the suburbs. These findings indicate the importance of the availability of open spaces for behavioral change in children. Discussions with public health experts outlined the dashboard's potential to aid in a better understanding of the interplay between children's obesogenic behaviors and the environment, and improvements were suggested. Conclusions: Our analyses serve as an initial investigation using the OPdashboard. Additional factors must be incorporated in order to optimize its use and obtain a clearer understanding of the results. The unique big data that are available through the OPdashboard can lead to the implementation of models that are able to predict population behavior. The OPdashboard can be considered as a tool that will increase our understanding of the underlying factors in childhood obesity and inform the design of regional interventions both for prevention and treatment.

%ABSTRACT = {Demand response has been widely developed during recent years to increase efficiency and decrease the cost in the electric power sector by shifting energy use, smoothening the load curve, and thus ensuring benefits for all participating parties. This paper introduces a Demand Response Alert Service (DRAS) that can optimize the interaction between the energy industry parties and end users by sending the minimum number of relatable alerts to satisfy the transformation of the load curve. The service creates appliance models for certain deferrable appliances based on past-usage measurements and prioritizes households according to the probability of the use of their appliances. Several variations of the appliance model are examined with respect to the probabilistic association of appliance usage on different days. The service is evaluated for a peak-shaving scenario when either one or more appliances per household are involved. The results demonstrate a significant improvement compared to a random selection of end users, thus promising increased participation and engagement. Indicatively, in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) index, the proposed method achieves, in all the studied scenarios, an improvement ranging between 41.33% and 64.64% compared to the baseline scenario. In terms of the F1 score index, the respective improvement reaches up to 221.05%.},

%ABSTRACT = {Fast self-reported eating rate (SRER) has been associated with increased adiposity in children and adults. No studies have been conducted among high-school students, and SRER has not been validated vs. objective eating rate (OBER) in such populations. The objectives were to investigate (among high-school student populations) the association between OBER and BMI z-scores (BMIz), the validity of SRER vs. OBER, and potential differences in BMIz between SRER categories. Three studies were conducted. Study 1 included 116 Swedish students (mean ± SD age: 16.5 ± 0.8, 59% females) who were eating school lunch. Food intake and meal duration were objectively recorded, and OBER was calculated. Additionally, students provided SRER. Study 2 included students (n = 50, mean ± SD age: 16.7 ± 0.6, 58% females) from Study 1 who ate another objectively recorded school lunch. Study 3 included 1832 high-school students (mean ± SD age: 15.8 ± 0.9, 51% females) from Sweden (n = 748) and Greece (n = 1084) who provided SRER. In Study 1, students with BMIz ≥ 0 had faster OBER vs. students with BMIz &lt; 0 (mean difference: +7.7 g/min or +27%, p = 0.012), while students with fast SRER had higher OBER vs. students with slow SRER (mean difference: +13.7 g/min or +56%, p = 0.001). However, there was “minimal” agreement between SRER and OBER categories (κ = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001). In Study 2, OBER during lunch 1 had a “large” correlation with OBER during lunch 2 (r = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001). In Study 3, fast SRER students had higher BMIz vs. slow SRER students (mean difference: 0.37, p &lt; 0.001). Similar observations were found among both Swedish and Greek students. For the first time in high-school students, we confirm the association between fast eating and increased adiposity. Our validation analysis suggests that SRER could be used as a proxy for OBER in studies with large sample sizes on a group level. With smaller samples, OBER should be used instead. To assess eating rate on an individual level, OBER can be used while SRER should be avoided.},

%abstract="Background: Obesity interventions face the problem of weight regain after treatment as a result of low compliance. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies could potentially increase compliance and aid both health care providers and patients. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability and usability and define system constraints of an mHealth system used to monitor dietary habits of adolescents in real life, as a first step in the development of a self-monitoring and lifestyle management system against adolescent obesity. Methods: We recruited 26 students from a high school in Stockholm, Sweden. After a 30-minute information meeting and 5-minute individual instruction on how to use an mHealth system (smartphone with app and two external sensors), participants used it for 2-3 weeks to objectively collect dietary habits. The app and sensors were used by the participants, without supervision, to record as many main meals and snacks as possible in real life. Feasibility was assessed following the ``mHealth evidence reporting and assessment checklist,'' and usability was assessed by questionnaires. Compliance was estimated based on system use, where a registration frequency of 3 main meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) per day for the period of the experiment, constituted 100{\%} compliance. Results: Participants included in the analysis had a mean age of 16.8 years (SD 0.7 years) and BMI of 21.9 kg/m2 (SD 4.1 kg/m2). Due to deviations from study instructions, 2 participants were excluded from the analysis. During the study, 6 participants required additional information on system use. The system received a `Good' grade (77.1 of 100 points) on the System Usability Scale, with most participants reporting that they were comfortable using the smartphone app. Participants expressed a willingness to use the app mostly at home, but also at school; most of their improvement suggestions concerned design choices for the app. Of all main meals, the registration frequency increased from 70{\%} the first week to 76{\%} the second week. Participants reported that 40{\%} of the registered meals were home-prepared, while 34{\%} of the reported drinks contained sugar. On average, breakfasts took place at 8:30 AM (from 5:00 AM to 2:00 PM), lunches took place at 12:15 PM (from 10:15 AM to 6:15 PM), and dinners took place at 7:30 PM (from 3:00 PM to 11:45 PM). When comparing meal occurrence during weekdays vs weekends, breakfasts and lunches were eaten 3 hours later during weekends, while dinner timing was unaffected. Conclusions: From an infrastructural and functional perspective, system use was feasible in the current context. The smartphone app appears to have high acceptability and usability in high school students, which are the intended end-users. The system appears promising as a relatively low-effort method to provide real-life dietary habit measurements associated with overweight and obesity risk. ",

abstract = {EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches are widely applied for identifying fairness issues in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, in the context of facial analysis, existing XAI approaches, such as pixel attribution methods, offer explanations for individual images, posing challenges in assessing the overall behavior of a model, which would require labor-intensive manual inspection of a very large number of instances and leaving to the human the task of drawing a general impression of the model behavior from the individual outputs. Addressing this limitation, we introduce FaceX, the first method that provides a comprehensive understanding of face attribute classifiers through summary model explanations. Specifically, FaceX leverages the presence of distinct regions across all facial images to compute a region-level aggregation of model activations, allowing for the visualization of the model's region attribution across 19 predefined regions of interest in facial images, such as hair, ears, or skin. Beyond spatial explanations, FaceX enhances interpretability by visualizing specific image patches with the highest impact on the model's decisions for each facial region within a test benchmark. Through extensive evaluation in various experimental setups, including scenarios with or without intentional biases and mitigation efforts on four benchmarks, namely CelebA, FairFace, CelebAMask-HQ, and Racial Faces in the Wild, FaceX demonstrates high effectiveness in identifying the models' biases.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in addressing real-world tasks by harnessing data-driven insights to optimize and enhance decision-making processes. Their application in robotics usually relies on simulations as an essential testing ground, allowing us to refine solutions, minimize risks, and fine-tune algorithms before deploying them in practical, physical environments. In this work, we evaluate the performance of two popular reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q Network (DQN): i) on an obstacle detection and avoidance task, and ii) on a navigation task. For this purpose, we rely on the FOSSBot open-source educational robot, which contains ultrasonic sensors, infrared obstacle sensors, an Inertial Measurement Unit, and odometers. More specifically, we work on a simulation of FOSSBot in the CoppeliaSim environment. The evaluation results on the grid environment are very promising for our algorithms since the success rates (i.e. reaching the destination without collision) for both algorithms is above 93\%. As for the simulated environment, the results show the superiority of PPO over DQN, with PPO scoring a success rate of 74\%, making it a promising navigation algorithm candidate for the real-world FOSSBot.},

%abstract="Nowadays, in many scientific and industrial fields there is an increasing need for estimating treatment effects and answering causal questions. The key for addressing these problems is the wealth of observational data and the processes for leveraging this data. In this work, we propose a new model for predicting the potential outcomes and the propensity score, which is based on a neural network architecture. The proposed model exploits the covariates as well as the outcomes of neighboring instances in training data. Numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed model reports better treatment effect estimation performance compared to state-of-the-art models.",

%abstract="Continual learning is a crucial ability for learning systems that have to adapt to changing data distributions, without reducing their performance in what they have already learned. Rehearsal methods offer a simple countermeasure to help avoid this catastrophic forgetting which frequently occurs in dynamic situations and is a major limitation of machine learning models. These methods continuously train neural networks using a mix of data both from the stream and from a rehearsal buffer, which maintains past training samples. Although the rehearsal approach is reasonable and simple to implement, its effectiveness and efficiency is significantly affected by several hyperparameters such as the number of training iterations performed at each step, the choice of learning rate, and the choice on whether to retrain the agent at each step. These options are especially important in resource-constrained environments commonly found in online continual learning for image analysis. This work evaluates several rehearsal training strategies for continual online learning and proposes the combined use of a drift detector that decides on (a) when to train using data from the buffer and the online stream, and (b) how to train, based on a combination of heuristics. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over baseline training strategies at a fraction of the computational cost.",

%abstract="Food texture is a complex property; various sensory attributes such as perceived crispiness and wetness have been identified as ways to quantify it. Objective and automatic recognition of these attributes has applications in multiple fields, including health sciences and food engineering. In this work we use an in-ear microphone, commonly used for chewing detection, and propose algorithms for recognizing three food-texture attributes, specifically crispiness, wetness (moisture), and chewiness. We use binary SVMs, one for each attribute, and propose two algorithms: one that recognizes each texture attribute at the chew level and one at the chewing-bout level. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on a dataset with 9 subjects. We also evaluate them using leave-one-food-type-out cross-validation, in order to examine the generalization of our approach to new, unknown food types. Our approach performs very well in recognizing crispiness (0.95 weighted accuracy on new subjects and 0.93 on new food types) and demonstrates promising results for objective and automatic recognition of wetness and chewiness.",

%abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in data availability and computational power, which has led to superior performance in training deep learning models for image classification. In many real-world use-cases, however, the training datasets come with noisy labels that have been automatically generated for a small subset of the available data. In this paper we explore strategies for maintaining classification performance when the labels become noisy and sparse. In particular, we evaluate the effectiveness of combining PENCIL, a framework for correcting noisy labels during training and AMDIM, a self-supervised technique for learning good data representations from unlabeled data. We find that this combination is significantly more effective when dealing with sparse and noisy labels, compared to using either of these approaches alone.},

title="Artificial intelligence and machine learning for objective intake monitoring",
%abstract="Introduction The progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning during the last decade has enabled the development of new and improved intake monitoring methods. Specifically, sensor-based objective monitoring has the potential to provide more accurate intake indicators compared to questionnaires, but can also provide detailed in-meal intake parameters that today are available only through time consuming, video-based manual annotations.  Objectives This presentation aims at providing an overview of our work on objective intake monitoring.  Methods We present two types of methods, one based on commercially-available smartwatches and one based on a prototype ear-worn chewing sensor. Smartwatch-based methods take advantage of the inertial sensors (triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope) available in modern smartwatches to detect intake gestures. It is shown that although individual movements are not sufficient to detect intake, modelling sequences of movements leads to accurate detection. For the chewing sensor, we evaluate an in-ear microphone as well as a photoplethysmography sensor for chewing detection.  Results We present results on several annotated datasets. The smartwatch-based intake monitoring methods achieve an accuracy of F1 score of 0.92 for detection of intake cycles and 0.96 for meals. Chewing sensor methods achieve 0.96 weighted accuracy and 0.91 F1 score for meal detection.  ",
