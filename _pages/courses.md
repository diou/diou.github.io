### Artificial Intelligence

>Introductory course on Artificial Intelligence (undergraduate). The course provides an introduction to basic concepts and definitions regarding artificial intelligence, summarizes the current state of art and introduces students to classic AI algorithms including algorithms for uninformed and informed search, adversarial search, constraint satisfaction problems, Markov Decision Processes and a brief introduction to reinforcement learning. Students apply these algorithms in Python projects.

### Machine Learning and Applications

> This is an introductory course for Machine Learning (undergraduate). It is heavily geared towards Artificial Neural Networks and their applications for tabular data, text, signals and images. Students learn elements of theory for training linear models and ANNs, convolutional neural networks and popular CNN architectures, as well as embedding-based architectures for processing text. The course relies heavily on projects that use scikit-learn and Tensorflow in Python.

### Programming I

> This course introduces students to programming using the C language (undergraduate). It offers an understanding to basic procedural programming concepts, of how memory is organized inside a computer, while it also introduces students to basic algorithms for sorting and searching.

### Artificial Intelligence and its Applications on the Internet of Things

> Course that is part of the [Informatics and Telematics](https://msc.dit.hua.gr/) postgraduate program. It explores how signals and data streams produced by IoT devices can be used to develop artificial intelligence application, with a focus on training of classification and regression models. 

### Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in Healthcare

> Course that is part of the [Digital Health and Analytics](https://mschealth.dit.hua.gr/) postgraduate program. It explores how deep learning algorithms can be useful for applications in healthcare.
