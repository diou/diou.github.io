Hello and welcome to my homepage. I am an Associate Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the [Department of Informatics and Telematics](https://www.dit.hua.gr), at the [Harokopio University of Athens](https://www.hua.gr), Greece, where I teach [courses](/courses) related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, as well as computer programming. I hold a BSc and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 

My research revolves around the development of novel machine learning algorithms, as well as their applications in healthcare. My recent research interests include the development the development of machine learning algorithms that generalize across domains (Domain Generalization), the use of machine learning for causal effect estimation from observational data, the development of methods for bias assessment and mitigation of multimodal models, and the development of feature effect methods for machine learning models that handle tabular data.

I have published several [papers](/publications) in international research journals and conferences in topics related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and their applications, while I have over 15 years of experience participating in national and international research projects. I am currently the PI for the EU-funded projects [REBECCA](https://rebeccaproject.eu/) and [RELEVIUM](https://www.releviumproject.eu/), while I also participate in projects [BETTER4U](https://better4u.eu/), [HUMAINE](https://humaine-horizon.eu/) and [MELIORA](https://melioraproject.eu/).
